## Nothing beats two words

The other day I was running ads and tried a few hooks:

-   **FREE GUIDE**
-   **HOW TRADIES ARE BOOKING 5–10 JOBS / MONTH**
-   **LOSING MONEY TO GOOGLE ADS?**

While these are vastly different ways of saying the same thing:

1. They’re all screaming at you
2. **FREE GUIDE** is simple — the other two take some time to read

Humans are lazy. Lazy wins every time. Every marketer knows this.

So of course, **FREE GUIDE** got more converted wayyyy better.

All because it hooked the reader in just **two words**.

Not 7.  
Not 5.

The point is to make your hook as **concise and to the point** as possible.

When you hook the fish, **then** you can reel them in with your fancy words.
