Hey,

Here’s an honest truth for today:

**Traditional advertising is a scam.**

Billboards are dead. Radios are dead (unless you’re 60+).

If you risk it as a local business, you’ll probably end up 6 feet under... in debt.

This is because old advertising methods are slow and expensive.

But what if they _didn’t have to be?_

Well guess what? They don’t.

**Run Google Ads, brother. (or sister...)**

It might not be flashy, but without them you’re almost invisible.

Imagine being able to pop up exactly when someone wants your service… **that’s Google Ads.**

Which is soooo much more efficient than a stupid billboard.

Think about it this way – when you want to buy Tacos, you Google it.

Not even thinking about the specific brand – “Yep this is it – it’s got good reviews….. _buy_”

You just gave your money to the guy who ran Google Ads.

In the modern world, that’s the entire buying process.

Even if someone has been researching a product for weeks, they end up on Google looking for a solution at the end of it – _“Plumber near me.”_

So skipping this, then complaining that you aren’t getting any business, isn’t a viable business model.

### Here’s how the buying journey works:

1. “I need [item]”
2. They Google it (“[thing] near me”)
3. They click the most appealing headline
4. They skim your site (checking if you’re a match)
5. Good fit? _Buy_. Bad fit? _Goes back to search_

There’s not much guesswork if you position yourself in the right place at the right time.

### You just need three things:

1. **A solid offer** – Something that’s worth clicking on
2. **A conversion-focused website** – Not a business card, a real sales machine
3. **A clear call to action** – “Book Now”, “Get a Quote”

A very clear lead magnet that can easily get your leads up very quickly.
