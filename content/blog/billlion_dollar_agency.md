# The Right Agency Is Hard To Find

Most "marketing agency" advice is written by people who don't even run a marketing agency.

You know the type. Those people that spent more time in zoom meetings than actually running ad campaigns.

One of my professors learnt all the textbook strategies (that all these agencies use too). When he tried to use them, it was a disaster. His only resort was to run ads. Can you guess what happened next?

> The ad salesman told me: "yeah, you should run it very often. Veeeeeerrrrrrryyyyy often"

Of course that's what he says. The guy got paid every time the ad ran.

What they teach in business school is great if you've got $600 Million to spend (Like Coca-Cola)

But if you're not flying private, these strategies will take _your_ money right into _their_ pocket with **nothing left for you**.

The secret is that: _Most marketing agencies are just middlemen who learned how to talk a good game._ They'll show you some charts, say 'brand awareness' a lot, and send you a bill that's sharper than a bee sting.

So how do you find a real marketing agency?

## 1. Look at Their Clients

The obvious, yet underutilized method is to look at what they've done before. Don't check out their website reviews, as they can easily be faked. Check out their Google & Facebook reviews. See what people say about them on Trustpilot.

If a marketing agency can't show you real results, real clients, or just proof that they know what they're doing, 99% of the time they're hiding something. Ask them for specifics - 'How many leads did you generate for (client)?', 'How long did it take?', etc..

Doing research is essential before throwing your money down the drain!

## 2. Ask About Their Process

Any marketing agency on the planet has a plan. For example, if you were to hire us our plan is to, in short:

1. Get an understanding of your business
2. Analyse your previous work, including websites & social media presence
3. Do keyword research on the most efficient places to target for your business, based on previous data
4. Ensure your website is up-to-date & efficient, [including SEO](https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo) (it's not all ads!)
5. Run ads based on all previous data

The marketing agency you choose should walk you through what they'll do, why they'll do it, and what you can expect _before_ giving you the decision to pay. If they can't, well... somethings wrong.

## 3. Do They Have Skin In The Game?

In other words, do they guarantee anything?

Take us for example, we only win if you win. Our entire paycheck relies on you getting results - not the other way around. Is the marketing agency you're looking at willing to risk their own business for the sake of yours?

Check out their website, socials, and blogs. Do they guarantee anything? Does that guarantee actually mean anything?

## Red Flags (or, How to Spot a Scammer in 10 seconds)

-   They make big promises, but can't back them up (150% results in 30 days!)
-   Their testimonials smell like ChatGPT, not real clients
-   They can't explain what they'll actually do _for you_.
-   Zero pricing transparency (that is, if you have to push them for pricing)
