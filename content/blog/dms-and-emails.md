These are both amazing, and a major issue.

### **Issue first:**

Any moron can send an email & DM.  
So you’re in competition with everyone.

_Don’t limit yourself to this method._
It’s not a great method for selling.

> “Your website is shit. Let me fix it.”

It doesn’t work because nobody will read your 6-paragraph-long explanation of why you should fix a box on their website.

### **So how should you do it?**

**_Build a connection._**

If you start out selling, you’ll be ignored.  
There’s no common ground. No rapport. Nothing.

To get a much higher chance of success, you need to have a real human conversation _before_ even trying to sell.

### **This is the email framework I like to use (it helps a lot):**

1. I found you through X.
2. I do Y.
3. Are you interested?

This also sorts out who’s interested and who isn’t.

---

Usually it makes sense to end up on a call, but sometimes people don’t want to.  
The point is: **you can’t just force your stuff down their spine.**  
It doesn’t work.

Maybe it did in the 30’s… but that’s 100 years ago...

Anyways, happy Friday!

Talk soon,

Ali.
