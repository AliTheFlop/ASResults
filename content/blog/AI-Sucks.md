# AI Sucks

Hey,

The other day I was running Meta Ads for myself and one thing caught my eye:

They constantly try to opt you into AI-stuff.

-   “AI Image Optimization”…
-   “AI Text”…
-   “AI flex size” (whatever that means)

It’s amazing how much they want their AI to run your business.

Some of it works well – like they auto-add music if your creatives don’t have any…

But the rest is terrible! Absolute mockery.

The reason I say this is that yes, AI knows what to say (most of the time), but it can never mimic human creativity.

If your plan is to just get content out there for the sake of it? By all means, use AI.

But if you want to create a real connection with your audience, AI is terrible for it.

Take a look at this. Which one is AI? A or B?

**A:**

> Still Dealing With That Nagging Pain?  
> We Fix It in 30 Minutes or Your Visit’s Free.  
> 📲 Book Now – Limited Spots This Week Only

**B:**

> Do you get constant back pain?  
> Get it fixed in 30 minutes or your visit’s free.  
> 📲 Book now (Offer ends Sunday)

**A is the AI version. B is human.**  
It’s not that AI is _bad_. That’s not what I’m saying.

I’m saying that it can’t mimic human thought processes and emotions.

Yes, it knows the buzzwords and copywriting tricks: “Nagging Pain?” “Limited Spots”…

But 90% of the time it’s overdone and lacks the “human quirks” which are essential for giving your content that relatable feeling.

> “Do you get constant back pain?” is something you can actually say “yes” to.

The truth is that people don’t buy from robots.  
They buy from **humans**.

Random quirks, voice cracks, terrible spelling (sometimes), inside jokes, etc…

They buy **you** as a human. That’s your primary differentiator.

So yeah, let AI optimize for you if that’s your thing…  
but the heart of your brand is your soul.

It’s gotta come out of your gut.  
Not a prompt.

**P.S.** I take the stress off local businesses by creating all advertisements and marketing under a real, human brain.
