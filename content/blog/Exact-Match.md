# Exact Match

A huge plus if you're running Google Ads:

Use the exact search keyword in your headline.

**"Emergency plumber near me"**

-   **Emergency Plumber Sydney - $0 Callout Fee**

It matches exactly what they searched for.

You become the best pick in the customer's mind automatically.

I saw this happen live once.

A pool installer was ranking #1 organically for **“pool installer sydney”**

Not because he was the best, or had the best SEO.

His headline was literally **“Pool Installer Sydney | Get A Free Quote”**.

Google said _“Yep, this is the guy”_, and he wasn’t even running ads.

Yet he was first.
