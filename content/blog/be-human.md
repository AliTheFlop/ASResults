Hey,

It’s Ali.

Wanted to explain one thing MANY people get wrong:

**Being human.**

It’s no secret that the secret to marketing is to _“be human”_

But that’s a very high-level overview of what you can do to _“be human”_ **_right now_**.

Think about this - what’s your favourite social media influencer?

When I was about 10-12 years old, my favourite was **DanTDM**.

If you’ve got kids, there’s a high chance you’ve heard of him. Fun dude to watch.

The reason he’s so big isn’t because he found some “secret” to engaging content.

It’s all because he’s as _“human”_ as he can be, and people relate to that.

In **ALL** of his videos, you can genuinely **UNDERSTAND** why he reacts the way he does.

Big spider? He screams. Of course he will! It’s a huge mfin spider.

On the other hand, some people would overdo it. Scream at the top of their lungs. Run away on screen.

It’s not a natural reaction to the scene, so **LOTS** of people won’t feel that human-to-human connection.

That translates to **less views**, and **less income**.

The point is, in **ALL** your marketing you must do one thing:

**Be as human as possible.**

Make your headlines relate to the reader.

Get rid of overdramatic buzzwords like _“Empower”_ or _“Transform”_.

You’ll get more money in the long run.

Talk soon,  
**Ali.**
